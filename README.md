**Accenture job simulation**

I recently participated in Accenture’s Data Analytics & Visualization job simulation on the Forage platform, and it was incredibly useful to understand what it might be like to participate in a typical project team at Accenture, and to use Excel and data analytics and visualization skills in a realistic context. 

Through this program I realized that I really enjoy cleaning, modeling and analyzing client data, creating slides to communicate findings and presenting insights back to the client. I would love to apply what I've learned in a diverse project team at a company like Accenture. 

Tasks undertaken:

Completed a simulation focused on advising a hypothetical social media client as a Data Analyst at Accenture

Cleaned, modelled and analyzed 7 datasets to uncover insights into content trends to inform strategic decisions

Prepared a PowerPoint deck and video presentation to communicate key insights for the client and internal stakeholders
